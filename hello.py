## This is my first python program
## As per software industry rituals i am also starting with "Hello World" program.

import sys

def main():
  print ("The script Name is", sys.argv[0])
  print ('Hello,World...!!!')

# This is the standard boilerplate that calls the main() function.
if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
